🚑 The Mission
In emergency medicine, the "closest" hospital isn't always the appropriate hospital. DFW ER Navigator Pro is a mission-critical web tool designed for paramedics and EMTs to quickly identify the nearest facility capable of handling specific patient needs—whether it's a Level 1 Trauma Center, a Comprehensive Stroke Center (CSC), or a specialized Burn Unit.

✨ Key Features
Live GPS Sorting: Automatically calculates real-time distance from your current location to every ER in the DFW metroplex.

Specialty Filtering: Instantly filter facilities by capabilities:

Trauma: Level I & II Centers.

Stroke: Primary (PSC) and Comprehensive (CSC) designations.

Cardiac: STEMI-capable facilities.

Specialized: Pediatrics (PEDS), Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBOT), and Burn Centers.

Secure Logistics: A protected "EMS Room" and "ER Door" code database to streamline patient handoff (Requires credential verification).

One-Touch Actions: Built-in buttons to trigger immediate phone calls to the ER or launch turn-by-turn navigation via Google Maps.

Community-Driven Updates: Integrated reporting system to keep facility codes and capabilities up-to-date via peer-sourced data.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Mapping: Leaflet.js & OpenStreetMap

Data: JSON-based hospital database with Haversine formula for distance calculations.
