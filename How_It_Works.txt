1. The Data Source: hospitals.json
This is the "brain" of your application. It acts as a flat-file database containing every piece of information the app needs to function.

Structure: Each hospital is an object containing geographical coordinates (latitude/longitude), specialty levels (Trauma, Stroke, etc.), and logistics (EMS room codes).

The Coordinates: These are critical because they allow the app to calculate the Haversine Distance (the "as-the-crow-flies" distance) between the medic's current GPS location and the ER.

Specialty Tags: Boolean values (true/false) allow the user to filter for specific needs, like a Burn Unit or a Level 1 Trauma center.

2. The User Interface: index.php
This is what the medic sees on their phone in the back of the ambulance. It performs three main tasks:

Geolocation: It asks the browser for the device's current coordinates using the navigator.geolocation API.

Distance Calculation: It fetches the hospitals.json file and runs a math script to compare the medic's location to every hospital in the list.

Dynamic Rendering: * It sorts the hospitals so the closest ones appear at the top.

It filters the list based on which buttons the medic clicks (e.g., clicking "STEMI" hides any hospital that isn't cardiac-capable).

It generates "Action Buttons" that deep-link into the phone’s OS to start a phone call or open Google Maps.

3. The Control Room: admin.php
Since hospital codes change and facilities upgrade their capabilities, you need a way to edit the data without writing code.

Authentication: It uses a simple password check to ensure only authorized users can modify the database.

The CRUD Loop (Create, Read, Update, Delete):

Read: It opens hospitals.json and displays the data in an editable form.

Update: When you change a door code or a trauma level and hit "Save," the script encodes that data back into the JSON format.

Write: It overwrites the old hospitals.json file with the new information.

Instant Updates: The moment you save in admin.php, every medic using the app sees the updated information the next time their page refreshes.
