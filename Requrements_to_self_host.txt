To host the ER Navigator Pro on your own server, here is the simplified list of requirements:

1. Hardware & Operating System
A computer or server that stays on 24/7 (like a Raspberry Pi, old laptop, or a Linux VPS, UNRIAD).
A Linux-based OS (Ubuntu or Debian are recommended for the best compatibility).

2. Software Stack (The "Engine")
Apache2 Web Server: To serve the website files.
PHP (Version 7.4 or higher): Required to run the logic in index.php and admin.php.
Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared): Is recomemended to securely connect your local server to your domain (yourdomain.com)
without opening router ports. (extra security)
And of course your own doamin name.

3. Necessary Files
You must place these three files in your web directory (usually /var/www/html/):
index.php:        The main user interface for the medics.
admin.php:        The password-protected portal to update data.
hospitals.json:   The database file containing hospital locations, specialty tags, and door codes.

4. Critical Permissions

Write Access: Your web server (Apache) must have permission to write to hospitals.json. Without this, the admin panel cannot
save new door codes or hospital updates.
SSL/HTTPS: Must be enabled through Cloudflare to ensure sensitive data (like ER door codes) is encrypted during transit.

5. Connectivity

Internet Access: For the server to talk to Cloudflare and for the app to load external map data (Leaflet.js).
GPS Enabled Device: The end-user (EMT/MEDIC) must have a device with GPS and must grant
location permissions for the distance sorting to work.
